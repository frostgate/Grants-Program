## Project Overview

### Overview

Frostgate is a modular interoperability protocol designed to enable secure, trust-minimized message transmission across heterogeneous blockchains. Rooted in our research of Succinct State Validation (SSV), Frostgate employs succinct cryptographic proofs to establish verifiable claims about state transitions on external chains. This design minimizes dependency on centralized relayers, multi-signature committees, or heavyweight consensus replication.

By treating each chain as an isolated context with its own finality semantics, Frostgate introduces Interoperability Chain Abstraction via its ChainAdapter interface, a canonical boundary for cryptographic externalization. This allows sovereign chains to interoperate via standardized proof systems, introducing modularity at the consensus and proof backends.

Rather than function as a traditional bridge, Frostgate acts as a protocol-level coprocessor, a foundational layer for interoperable applications, enabling cross-chain messaging, asset flows and shared state logic while preserving the integrity and sovereignty of participating chains.

### Motivation

Most existing interoperability protocols introduce additional trust assumptions. These are brittle and often the weakest link in cross-chain design.

Frostgate is built around a simple but powerful premise: **trust cryptography, not governance**. By using cryptographic proofs to verify cross-chain states and messages, we avoid replication, consensus simulation, and multisig centralization. It offers a verifiable-first approach that aligns with Web3 core principles: open, decentralized, and trustless. We believe that this approach is the end-game of interoperability for heterogeneous chains, regardless of underlying architecture.

### How Frostgate Differs from Existing Solutions

Unlike existing interoperability solutions, Frostgate eliminates trust assumptions through pure cryptographic verification:

| Feature | Frostgate | LayerZero | Axelar | IBC |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Trust Model | ZK Proofs Only | Oracle + Relayer | Validator Set | Light Client |
| Substrate Native | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Partial | ‚ùå |
| ZK Backend Agnostic | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Verification Method | On-chain ZK | Off-chain Oracle | Validator Consensus | Light Client Sync |
| Governance Dependencies | No core dependecies | Oracle Selection | Validator Governance | Client Updates |

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Pure Cryptographic Verification**: No validator sets, no oracles, no committees
- **Modular ZK Backends**: Support for SP1, Halo2, RiscZero without vendor lock-in  
- **Native Substrate Integration**: Built specifically for Polkadot ecosystem requirements
- **Chain Sovereignty**: No shared security assumptions or governance dependencies

## Project Details

#### **Interoperability as Verifiable Message-Passing**

Let each chain $C$ be a deterministic state machine with transition function $\delta$. Frostgate encodes cross-chain state transitions as authenticated messages $M: \{C_i \rightarrow C_j\}$, each accompanied by a succinct cryptographic witness $\pi_M$ attesting to the finality and validity of the originating event.

Acceptance on the destination chain is reduced to a single predicate:

$$
\text{Accept}_{C_j}(M) \iff V_j(\pi_M) = 1
$$

where $V_j$ is a backend-agnostic verifier.

#### **Finality as a Security Primitive**

Finality is formalized as a predicate $F$, mapping blocks to their consensus status:

$$
F(b_i) = 1 \iff \text{Consensus}_{C_i}(b_i) = \text{final}
$$

Frostgate's adapters abstract over both BFT and probabilistic finality, ensuring only finalized events are eligible for cross-chain export.

#### **Chain Abstraction via ICAP**

Every chain implements a **ChainAdapter**, an interface contract, not a binding dependency. This adapter is responsible for:
- Extracting finalized events
- Encoding messages under the Frostgate specification
- Exposing finality and proof-generation hooks

This abstraction empowers any chain community to author their own adapters, fostering a truly open, permissionless ecosystem.

### Core Components (MVP Scope)

#### `frostgate-icap`

Implements the Interoperable Chain Abstraction Protocol (ICAP), defining a trait-based abstraction over blockchain behaviors. Initial focus on Substrate chains only.

- `ChainAdapter` composed of subtraits:
  - `FinalityProvider`
  - `MessageSubmitter` 
  - `MessageProver`
  - `EventListener`
  - `CapabilityProvider`

#### `frostgate-zkip`

Defines the ZK backend plugin interface (`ZkBackend` trait) with initial SP1 implementation only. Other backends (Halo2, RiscZero) will be added in future iterations.

#### `frostgate-sdk`

Developer SDK providing core types and utilities:
- `FrostMessage` (canonical cross-chain message format)
- `ChainId` (Substrate-focused initially)
- `MessageVerifier<B: ZkBackend>`

### Use Case (MVP)

The initial implementation focuses on Substrate-to-Substrate message passing within the Polkadot ecosystem. A parachain emits an outbound message event, the Substrate ChainAdapter verifies finality via GRANDPA, generates a ZK proof using SP1, and transmits it to the destination parachain where it's verified via the Frostgate pallet.
